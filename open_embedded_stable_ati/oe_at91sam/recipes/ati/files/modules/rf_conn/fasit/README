MCP (on x86 virtual machine running on SmartRange computer)
 - many clients (minions) connect to SmartRange
 - server for basestation/HHC connection
 - minions converts FASIT messages to RF and vice versa
 - minions simulate FASIT target
 - mcp.c = main loop starts minions, listens to RF messages
 - minion.c = main minion handling
 - minion_state.c = main simulation handling 

RFmaster.arm (on basestation/HHC)
 - connects to MCP
 - talks to radio
 - RFmaster.c = main loop and handling RF message transport

RFslave.new.arm (on target mechanism)
 - talks to radio
 - connects to slaveboss
 - RFslave_main.c = main loop for handling file descriptors
 - RFslave_data.c = functions for handling RF message transport

slaveboss.arm (on target mechanism)
 - server for RFslave.new.arm
 - converts RF messages to FASIT and vice versa
 - FASIT server for target
 - slaveboss.c = main loop for handling file descriptors
 - slaveboss_rf.c = functions for handling RF to FASIT translation
 - slaveboss_fasit.c = functions for handling FASIT to RF translation

Message flow to target:
SmartRange -> MCP -> RFmaster.arm ~ radio waves ~ RFlsave.new.arm -> slaveboss.arm -> fasit_conn

Message flow from target:
fasit_conn -> slaveboss.arm -> RFslave.new.arm ~ radio waves ~ -> RFmaster.arm -> MCP -> SmartRange
