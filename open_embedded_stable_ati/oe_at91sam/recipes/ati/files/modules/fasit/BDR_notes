In fasit.h there are the structures:

//  from ICD.FASIT.SYS 2.1
/* 100 - Device Definition Request          */
  FASIT_100
FC 
  a PD    responds with 2111 
  a PYRO  will respond with 2005 (not done)
  other devices respond with thier capabilities, if implimented 

SR sends this when a PD first makes a connection 

//  from ICD.FASIT.PYRO 2.1
/* 2000 - Pyro Event Command                */
 FASIT_2000;
FC does not support yet
SR does not support yet
BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.

/* 2004 - Pyro Event Command Acknowledge    */
 FASIT_2004;
FC does not support yet
SR does not support yet
BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.

/* 2005 - Pyro Device ID & Capabilities     */
 FASIT_2005;
FC does not support yet
SR does not support yet
BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.

/* 2006 - Pyro Device Status                */
 FASIT_2006;

BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.

// from ICD.FASIT.PD 1.1
/* 2100 - Event Command                     */
 FASIT_2100  received from SR
FC 
  Brynn is now implimenting the handling of this command in the FC,
and responds with the proper response which might be a 2101, a 2102,
or even a 2112, 2115, or 2113 depending.

SR sends a 2100 message, but FC is not replying
SR  there are many options to this command and they all need to be tested

/* 2101 - Event Command Acknowledge         */
 FASIT_2101  Sent to SR
FC 
   Now sending 2101 acknowledgements.   I think in all the proper spots
SR has code to handle this response from a 2100,  and it looks like it works.

/* 2102 - Presentation Device Status   */
 FASIT_2102  Sent to SR
FC never recievesthis message, only transmits
FC has this implimented, at least for buttons on the dev board
   there are a few other times that this gets sent, and I have added some of them.
SR has code to receive this, I am pretty sure it doesn't entirely work.

/* 2110 - Configure Muzzle Flash Command    */
 FASIT_2110  Received from SR
FC responds with either a 2112 status
   or a 2101 negative Ack
SR does not support yet

/* 2111 - PD Device ID & Capabilities          */
 FASIT_2111   Send to SR
FC never receives this, but it transmits it
  in response to a 100
  defheader does not have a case for 2111 - if needed
FC sends the 2111 response.
FC  Should also respond with a 

SR has code to handle this, unknown what state it is in.

/* 2112 - Muzzle Flash Simulation Status    */
 FASIT_2112   sent to SR
FC does not support yet
   needs to send this in response to a 2110,
   or in response to a 2100 CID_Status_request
SR does not support yet

/* 2113 - GPS Location                      */
 FASIT_2113
FC does not support yet
SR does not support yet
BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.


/* 2114 - Configure MILES Shootback Command */
 FASIT_2114;
FC does not support yet
SR does not support yet
BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.

/* 2115 - MILES Shootback Status            */
 FASIT_2115;
FC Seems to be code to generate a 2115 response to a 2114,
   but I don't think the 2114 is handled yet
SR does not support yet
BDR my understanding is Action Target doesn't do this.
